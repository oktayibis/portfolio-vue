    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      A Front-End Developer who loves to keep up with current technologies is a lifelong student, and works hard to make contributions that will make a difference to projects. I had the opportunity to work on dozens of different projects and used many front-end technologies. While respecting core development principles and best practices, I am also fearless to try innovations, this also helps me to leave my comfort zone.
